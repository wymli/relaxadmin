# What is relax admin?
A SPA fe admin app built without npm/node/yarn/webpack/react/angular/vue...

# Design Goals
## What is useless?
- no `npm/yarn/...` to install 3rd-pkgs...
- no `react/angular/vue/...` to build fe app
- no `webpack/...` to pack/bundle fe app
- no `makefile` to manage project

## What is useful?
- direct download 3rd-pkgs or use cdn
- use pure js with `jquery` to select elements and ajax
- use `tailwindcss`
- use simple ui pkg, like `jquery-ui`, or whatever you like. Just import it use cdn!
- use `just` to manage project, instead of `makefile`
- use `go` as backend language, simple and fast
- use `gvm` to manage go version
- use `go template` to generate `SPA`

# Demo in local
`just donwload && just dev`
